<p>Here I&#39;ll show you how to use FTS so that you can have great SEO.</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#39;ll a domain that uses a distributed CDN.</li>
<li>We&#39;ll add sitemap to google webmaster dashboard for said domain</li>
<li>We add FTS for the site</li>
<li>We boost our page rank</li>
</ul>
<p>Without SEO, you website is just a brochure that only you hand out, but w/ SEO, it is a store window where people walk by and look, 24X7, and world wide audience - potentially of trillions.
If you are a pro - by definition you make money: either via page views of your content or by selling/e-commerce - and both require good SEO. Good SEO gives you a constant and free stream of leads. I wish I can tell you that SEO is quick and onetime, it&#39;s not. But there is a trick to it. So before we jump into it, I&#39;ll tell you a trick to SEO: FTS! Google has CSE <a href="https://cse.google.com">https://cse.google.com</a> so you can search your site (and not have to use silly Solar in the cloud and such). The paid version ( $8 / month ) of Google CSE lets you do an instant scan of your content. W/o that - you have to wait to see how the SEO turns out. Wait weeks per each tweak. Hardly feasible.
In theory, and only in theory you could get SEO to work w/o Google CSE - if you like a lot of pain.  With instant index, you can tune things as you are working on them. :-)</p>
<p>So lets start w/ the labor that is SEO; because $$$ is good. It may take a few days of lab time - and needs ongoing SEO tuning - and arguing for more interesting content :-)</p>
<h2 id="0-of-course-content">0. Of course, content</h2>
<p>You should first have some rewarding articles to view(more than once?), or some nice things to sell, or both. Also it should be presented in a more interesting way than others present it - UI Effects.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have millions of concurrent users, you can skip steps 1 and 2 and go to step 3.</p>
<h2 id="1-fast">1. Fast</h2>
<p>Latency counts in SEO page rank.</p>
<p>You may need a &lt;no-script&gt; version of your app, or at least a less rich version - something approaching AMP.
If you know how to App-shell, this is easy to do. You have one version of your app that is great UX for mobile apps, native mobile apps, chrome/FF/Safari and current version of IE.
Now you may need to create a second version of your App-shell: AMP like. Recall that AMP has no script. Oder version of IE struggle. And SEO does not use .js. So some reasons to create 2 html files per page.
If you use Pug or such to make an index.html using an App-shell X, now you may need to make another App-shell &#39;AMP&#39;.
IMPORTANT: you can now see that when you make a component, you always pass in the data, you don&#39;t have a widget get the data direct - AMP won&#39;t use your rich UI components in the same way. AMP shell goal may be to make a 40K download for the entire page.</p>
<p>Recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>But in any case, your content must display fast. Your images must be very small - very very small. Sometimes you show nice images and sometimes you show fast(lossy) images. Image size is part of SEO - due to performance aspect.</p>
</li>
<li><p>And your content MUST be on a distributed CDN (ex: CDN77 has ftp. CDN77 is $12 / month). And SEO indexing now is mobile first - so for SEO: mobile first.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Two version of your html pages is optional. But CDN and fast images is not - you must deploy site to CDN.
You&#39;ll need to register a domain (ex: easydns $5 / month). Before you SEO - you need a (https) domain that works - so we optimize it.</p>
<p>Aside: You should also monitor (ex. monitis is ~ $15 / month <a href="http://monitis.com/free-tools">http://monitis.com/free-tools</a> )</p>
<h2 id="2-lab-2-setup-your-naked-https-domain">2 Lab 2: Setup your (naked) HTTPS domain</h2>
<p>In case you don&#39;t know, CNAME your DNS to CDN, of course. We must use https - as some HTML5 features only work in https.
Your naked name will just redirect to your distributed CDN. Ex: Name.com will redirect to <a href="https://www.name.com">https://www.name.com</a>, where www is CDN provided CNAME.</p>
<p><img src="/post/seo/setup.png" alt="">
 The CDN provides https certs - you don&#39;t have to do that. It should looks something like above (here I also use them for video hosting). You can see that my origin on site44 is now distributed via CDN as masons-foundation.org. (But your origin should be secret to prevent DDOS). Also - unlike your origin, CDN is cached, so you have to flush it after update so it&#39;s not stale.</p>
<p>But first create a node box, where you&#39;ll run the little http <em>express</em> server. The express server will answer every request with a permanent redirect to www (CDN)</p>
<p>I advise against CloudFlare, AWS, GoDaddy and other toys. You are better of using something site44 only.</p>
<p>(CDN acts as a proxy to hide your origin and manage access to your static web app. For API, you can use an approach like 3Scale.net - also a proxy. For API of course use a different domain name)</p>
<h2 id="3-lab-3-half-step-to-cse">3. Lab 3: Half step to CSE</h2>
<p>We need to tell google search engine that we are the owners of this domain.
<img src="/post/seo/0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can do that on &#39;google webmaster console &#39;</p>
<p>And setup robots.txt</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://varvy.com/robottxt.html">http://varvy.com/robottxt.html</a>
and site map</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html">http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-lab-4-cse">4. Lab 4: CSE</h2>
<p>Now setup FTS on your site, so that user can find content/product of interest.
Ex:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://masons-foundation.org/en/about/search">http://masons-foundation.org/en/about/search</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/post/seo/$.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Paid version is $8 per month - and lets us do instant submit.</p>

<pre><code>    script.
        (function() {
            var cx = &#39;015406677380205718189:esv77diws9e&#39;;
            var gcse = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);
            gcse.type = &#39;text/javascript&#39;;
            gcse.async = true;
            gcse.src = &#39;//cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=&#39; + cx;
            var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;script&#39;)[0];

    div
    :verbatim
        &lt;gcse:searchresults&gt;&lt;/gcse:searchresults&gt;
</code></pre><p>It should look like:</p>

<h2 id="5-seo">5 SEO</h2>
<p>Once sitemap and CSE FTS works, you have SEO.</p>
<h2 id="6-important-pagerank-lab-twitter">6 IMPORTANT - PageRank - Lab: Twitter</h2>
<p>Now you need to create a separate page to point to your pages - some silly static site like google blog - where you blatantly increase your page rank.</p>
<p>And social networks, such as twitter. But before you spam social network - lets play nice:</p>
<pre><code>    block head
        &lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:card&quot; content=&quot;summary&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:url&quot; content=&quot;@puppetMaster3&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;About Masons-Foundation&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Masons-Foundation help web designers and offers a software scaffolding&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:image&quot; content=&quot;http://edge.masons-foundation.org/16/about/member1.jpg&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre><p>This will insert meta tags into your &lt;head&gt; so that people can paste the url and get images.

<p>So lets get twitter to work, as a lab.</p>
<h2 id="7-the-end">7 The end</h2>
<p>There are alternatives:
<img src="/post/seo/alt.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>So here:</p>
<ul>
<li>we created a https domain we want to optimize - that uses a distributed CDN</li>
<li>we added sitemap to google webmaster dashboard</li>
<li>we added FTS for the site (as SEO trick)</li>
<li>we boosted our page rank</li>
