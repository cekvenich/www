## Consulting

I'm trying to collect a library of web components - so I can make a directory. I offer to write 3 web components for $150 ($50 each) - using RIOT. You must have the specs ready (else book consulting). After paying, email me the specs. Usually it takes only a few days.

If you need to discuss, or other custom consulting/programming, such as making your existing web app more maintainable, the daily rate is $800. The rate for a bran new projects is $1K - due to exploration. I have a window open now, I'm back on a major project next month.

Guaranty: All fees have a guaranty - they are refundable if you are not happy!

Also, I offer a private class for your org on best practices - hands on, instructor led labs. Plus travel costs.

Some companies can pay by emailing a P.O. 30 day payable are 10% more (or pre-pay and get a discount).

Payments are to Masons-Foundation, a registered not for profit.
