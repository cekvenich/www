        <h3 id="star-rating-component-example">Star Rating Component Example</h3>
<p>We will turn a &quot;start rating&quot; feature into a Web Component:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nashio/star-rating-svg">https://github.com/nashio/star-rating-svg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>First we draft a page without a component. Inspect it here:
<a href="https://1595566120.rsc.cdn77.org/post/comp/index0.html">https://1595566120.rsc.cdn77.org/post/comp/index0.html</a></p>
<p>Each star &#39;element&#39; has an intial rating. You can mouse-over or click to change the rating.</p>
<p>View the HTML source. See the non-componentized JavaScript constructor $(&#39;.my-rating&#39;).starRating...( This 
initializes the star elements.
Also see the calls to  $(&#39;#rating...&#39;).starRating(&#39;setRating&#39;, ...). They set initial values of the non-componentized 
star elements.</p>
<p>By using components we can develop interactive applications that are easier 
to maintain. The compoment will encapsulate its code. As a result, the page markup will look cleaner 
and if done right, the component will be re-useable.</p>
<p>RIOT.js is one of several web component libraries. We use it here because it is easy to learn. You can always
study other component libraries in a next step.</p>
<p>We want to be loosely coupled to the particular web component&#39;s library architecture. For this, we use an 
independent observer in case the web component needs to send a message to the containing page 
(<a href="http://github.com/millermedeiros/js-signals/wiki">http://github.com/millermedeiros/js-signals/wiki</a> )</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s time to create the compontent with the RIOT syntax. View the HTML source of this URL to see the component code:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://1595566120.rsc.cdn77.org/_uiComps/star-rating.html">http://1595566120.rsc.cdn77.org/_uiComps/star-rating.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And use it on a page: <a href="https://1595566120.rsc.cdn77.org/post/comp/">https://1595566120.rsc.cdn77.org/post/comp/</a>
The page should be now easier to maintain. </p>
<p>To avoid page jank, we ensure that the component is not visible until ready. In this example 
we did not encapsulate the resources (ex: .js file). You would normally use something like 
<a href="http://github.com/muicss/loadjs">http://github.com/muicss/loadjs</a> synchronized with the component&#39;s mount event. </p>
<p>This should get you on the road to mastery.

<h3 id="best-practices-and-conclusion">Best Practices and Conclusion</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do a working page without component first.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t fetch data from component. Fetch in page, and send to component.</li>
<li>Use BEM-sized components. Page is not a component, neither is Button.</li>
<li>To avoid page jank, try to size the component in the page CSS and hide the component until ready.</li>
<li>Make components emit events to notify the page.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t nest components.</li>
<li>Build components for re-use.</li>
<li>Components should be served and hosted from a component web server, behind a CDN.</li>
<li>Components should load their own uniqe resources, ex: .js. Common resources such as jQuery will be loaded ahead. </li>
<li>Components should pick up the style of the page. When you put it on another web site it should look &#39;native&#39;.</li>
<li>UI Designer should implement the web components.</li>
</ol>
<p>When doing mobile version of the page, such as AMP, you can use iframes, like these guys did for example:
