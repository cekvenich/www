# bp - interaction-focused CMS. no php, all HTM5/node.

## Conversion Phases

### Phase I. 
Once you decide to convert you web app/-site to bp, identify a smaller less used section to convert first. For example, if you have sport, jewelry  and 'home and gardens', pick one as the first section to convert.
During the conversion, the main landing pages are still old, and only when you go to the new sections bp is used. Majority of sections are still old. The main thing here is that you maintain the functionality.

### Phase II.
 After that phase, where only one section is used, the next phase is to replace just the main landing pages or 'section homes'. In this phase, the landing pages/navigation and one section will be in bp. But the majority of sections are still old, just landing pages are new.
SEO should start improving, AMP should work. You should begin converting to API/'REST' and JWT.

 ### Phase III.
Convert the left-over sections to bp until the majority of the web app/-site is converted.
You can also release mobile apps, as you now you have a Single Page Application (SPA) feel.

### Phase IV.
If you took shortcuts, you may need to repeat the process, and go back to Phase I to polish and clean up.
